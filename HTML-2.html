                <p>I am a engineering student with Thinkful in San Diego, California</p>
                <p>The world does not stop moving, neither does technology. I decided I wanted to be a part of never ending movement that technology has to offer.</p>

                <h2 class="text-centered">Who I am</h2>
                <p>I graduated college with a Bachelors of Science, Clinical Physiology degree. I was an aspiring
                Physcian Assistant and was accepted into the school of my dreams. As I grew farther into the 
                career that I thought was for me, I actually grew farther away from it and closer to software engineering.
                I want to be a part of the impact of technology. I grew fonder about how all our records are held and communicated
                through the computer. How fascinating it is that technology makes the world closer together, even being miles and miles apart.

                I took a leap of faith, left the medical field, and enrolled to Thinkful to start my journey as a software developer.
                This is the scariest and one of the most difficult chances I have ever taken on myself but I am happy.</p>

                <br>If you're looking to hire a: 
                <ul>
                    <li>new</li>
                    <li>ambitous</li>
                    <li>kind</li>
                </ul>
                developer please reach out. I am so excited to learn so much
                from my teammates and impact the world through software development.
